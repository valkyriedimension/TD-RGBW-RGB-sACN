# TD-RGBW-RGB-sACN
This example uses an Advatek A4-S Mk III decoder to send data to the LEDs. The settings used for the decoder can be found within the TD node network.

This example makes use of TouchDesigner forum user [flowb's](https://forum.derivative.ca/u/flowb/summary) shader to find the correct white value to use with the RGBW LEDs.
